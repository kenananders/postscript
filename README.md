# Postscript Interpreter in Python <br>

There are two files for this interpreter:
- **the 'test_psip.py' that contains 47 test functions for the application in regards to most of the operation functions implemented and can be run with pytest using 'pytest test_psip.py'**
- **The 'psip.py' that contains the logic and function implementations for the entire interpreter**

The program is run by simply running the 'psip.py' file with 'python(3) psip.py'. From here, enter input one at a time (ie 1, 2, add). All default operations implemented are displayed in the 'psip.py' file and the Canvas assignment page for default Postscript commands. Switching between Dynamic and Lexical scoping is done by entering 'dynamic' or 'lexical' when the interpreter is running. The interpreter uses Dynamic Scoping by default and has mostly implemented the Lexical scoping logic with working subfunctions.
